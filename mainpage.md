This site documents the code provided in the Midd-Cool skeleton. It is auto-generated from comments in the source code and so does not contain any more information than the source code (it can be much easier to navigate). Use the Classes and Files dropdowns above to find the code relevant to the assignment you are working on.

These pages exclusively document the code itself. Check out the README files for information about how to compile the assignments, run the testing infrastructure, etc..

You will not necessarily need to use all of this code, i.e. just because a class is provided in the skeleton doesn't mean you must use it in your implementation. The individual assignment PDFs and README files specify which code is optional and which is not.
